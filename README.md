# beatSticks
Haptic Drumming Device | Ultra Portable Electronic Drums (stick-embedded)

TL;DR 
This project aims to develop a portable electronic drum that is hit-sensitive (this is not an Air-Drumming device such as "Aerodrums" or "Freedrums")

The goal is to create a multisensor device that detects dynimc hitting of the stick on any surface, combined with a 3d motion sensor that, depending on the orientation of the stick, triggers different sounds (MIDI notes) to a computer.
